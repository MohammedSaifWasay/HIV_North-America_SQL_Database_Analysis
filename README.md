## 📚 Introduction

This study explores HIV incidence, mortality, and socio-demographic impact in North America (2007–2016). Using datasets from **UNICEF**, **UNAIDS**, **UN Data**, and the **World Bank**, and analyzing with SQL and Excel, we aim to derive actionable insights for public health interventions.

## 📥 Data Collection and Methods

- **Sources:** UNICEF, UN Data, World Bank, UNAIDS  
- **Tools Used:** SQL (data processing), Excel (visualization), statistical analysis  
- **Methodology:** Extract-transform-load (ETL), KPI calculations, trend identification

---

## 📈 Results

### Table 1 — HIV Statistics  
- Mortality rates, new HIV cases, child-specific stats, and gender-based data  
- Time Period: 2007–2016  
- Focus: Canada & USA  

### Table 2 — Country-Level Info  
- GDP per capita  
- Population size  
- Unemployment rates  

---

## 🔄 Data Integration & Analysis

- Combined health data with socio-economic data  
- Correlated GDP, population, and unemployment with HIV indicators  
- Enabled multi-dimensional analysis for policy relevance

---

## 🇨🇦 Findings & Insights: Canada

- **Mortality rate** dropped from **70.49 (2007)** to **32.15 (2016)**  
- **Total HIV cases** increased to **159,385.69**  
- **Children with HIV** remained steady (~500); **new child cases** declined  
- **% of women with HIV** rose from **23.6% to 24.9%**

📈 Trends imply better treatment outcomes but ongoing transmission issues.

---

## 🇺🇸 Findings & Insights: USA

- **Mortality rate** fell from **97.44 to 46.62**  
- **Total HIV cases** increased similarly to Canada  
- **New cases in children** stayed low, indicating strong pediatric prevention  
- **% of women with HIV** decreased slightly: **24.4% to 22.5%**

📉 Improvements in treatment and survival; transmission still a concern.

## 🧠 Implications & Recommendations

### Key Implications
1. **Economic Disparity Impact:** GDP positively correlates with lower mortality  
2. **Pediatric HIV:** Stable child case counts require prevention monitoring  
3. **Women’s Health:** Rising female infection rates need targeted support  

### Recommendations
- Expand **healthcare access** in low-GDP areas  
- Fund **targeted pediatric programs**  
- Promote **gender-specific awareness and screening campaigns**

---

## 📉 Research Evaluations

### 📊 Evolution of HIV Cases (2007–2016)
- **Canada:** Gradual increase (steady rise, improved mortality)  
- **USA:** Consistent growth in total cases; reduced mortality  

### 👶 Child HIV Trends
- **Canada:** Drop to 269 cases  
- **USA:** Declined to 7,430  

### 👩‍🍼 Pregnant Women HIV Status Awareness
- Both countries saw fluctuations, underlining prenatal testing challenges

---

## 💡 Key Learnings

- Population size significantly influences HIV statistics  
- Economic factors (GDP, unemployment) shape healthcare access  
- Gender-focused insights are crucial for tailored interventions  
- Interdisciplinary data integration enhances policy relevance  

---

## ✅ Conclusion

This analysis emphasizes the importance of integrated data-driven strategies to manage HIV in North America. Continued surveillance, inclusive policies, and focused programs are essential to reducing prevalence and improving quality of life for affected populations.
